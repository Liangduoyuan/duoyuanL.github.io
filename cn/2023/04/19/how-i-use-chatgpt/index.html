<div class="body-text list-text">
<p>A knife cuts both ways“. Whether AI will replace humans, maybe we should consider from a different perspective.</p>
<p><strong>A Metaphor</strong></p>
<p>If we regard the invention of AI as the discovery of coal mines, mediocre people will see themselves as a piece of coal and compete with the mines, which will of course be uncompetitive. However, smart people will see themselves as coal mine owners and try their best to develop the mines.</p>
<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>
<p>Thinking of a simple scenario. Suppose someone had 8000 dollars and the cost of hiring one person was 1000 dollars. It might cost 800,000 dollars to start a project, which is a hundred times more than he had. Previously, he might not be able to launch the project due to insufficient funds. Now, with the emergence of AI, hiring an AI that can do most of the work people do costs only $10. He can launch the project with just $8000.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the gap between initial capital and budget disappears instantly, enabling many innovative individuals to initiate projects at a low cost. If they are still unable to succeed, they should consider that the problem may lie with themselves.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT Into Processes</strong></p>
<p>1.What is your ultimate goal?</p>
<p>2.What is the structure of the entire problem?</p>
<p>3.Consider which part of the structure can be assisted by ChatGPT. ChatGPT can help you with the parts that you feel unclear.</p>
<p><strong>How I Use ChatGPT</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Searching for Resources</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the most helpful things about ChatGPT is its ability to search for resources on any topic. Whenever I need to find information that may be difficult to obtain through traditional search engines like Baidu or Google, or that would take me a lot of time, I turn to ChatGPT. It provides me with a list of relevant resources, effectively saving me a significant amount of time compared to before.</p>

<p><em><strong>Structuring My Ideas</strong></em></p>
<p>In general, people prefer to revise rather than create. When I am exploring a new topic, I often struggle to structure my ideas. However, with ChatGPT&rsquo;s help, I can create a framework for start. I start by asking ChatGPT to provide me with an outline of the topic, and then I use revise outline and expand upon it. This helps me to stay focused and quickly know the area that I don&rsquo;t know before.</p>

<p><em><strong>Find New Perspectives</strong></em></p>
<p>I can ask ChatGPT to role-play as Confucius, Shakespeare, Steve Jobs, or other famous figures and then ask for their perspective on a particular issue. By role-playing as these figures, ChatGPT can offer unique insights and perspectives that I may nerver have considered before. It&rsquo;s a fun and creative way to explore different viewpoints and ideas.</p>

<p><em><strong>Polishing My English Writing</strong></em></p>
<p>Whether I am trying to make my writing more conversational or more professional, ChatGPT can identify my grammatical error and suggest the right words to me. For example, I&rsquo;m preparing my IELTS test and I want to make my writing more professional and my spoken materials more natural. So, I request ChatGPT to revise my work and  compare ChatGPT&rsquo;s suggestions with my own writing, and I learn new words and phrases that I can use in my own writing. This has been a great way for me to practice my English and improve my writing skills.</p>
<p>First paragraph by myself. Second  paragraph by ChatGPT. Third paragraph by mixed</p>

<p><em><strong>Just For Fun</strong></em></p>
<p>There are a lot of amazing plug-ins in Chrome Web Store(need magic way to open it) like Voice control for ChatGPT(allow you to have conversations with ChatGPT by speaking), YouTube Videos Summary Easy Copy with ChatGPT(function as the name suggests) and etc. If you use ChatGPT4.0(um, it is really nice if you&rsquo;re rich), which can be equipped with Wolfram Alpha, a mathematical search engine, to solve both science and arts questions.</p>
<p>By the way, I try to use ChatGPT to write Stata code and do annotation. The result was not bad and barely passed.</p>

<p>ChatGPT has been a game-changer for me. I highly recommend ChatGPT to you.</p>
